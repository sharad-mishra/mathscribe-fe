## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React (TypeScript)**: Component-based architecture for building the UI.
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast development environment.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Modern utility-first CSS framework.
- **Axios**: For API communication with the backend.

### Backend:
- **FastAPI**: Python framework used for backend services.
- [Find the backend repo here: MathScribe Backend](link-to-backend-repo)

### API Integration:
- **Google Gemini API**: For processing and solving handwritten equations.

## 🖥️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js (v16+)
- Yarn or npm

### Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sharad-mishra/mathscribe-fe.git
cd mathscribe-fe
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up the `.env` file: Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following:
```javascript
VITE_API_URL=<Your Backend API URL>
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## 🖌️ Customization

### Brush and Board Colors:
Navigate to the drawing board and use the UI options to switch between various brush and board themes.

### Math Expression Solver:
Draw any mathematical expression directly on the board. The backend processes the drawing using the Gemini API and returns the result in real-time.

## 🚀 Deployment

The project is already deployed via Vercel.

For deployment:

1. Install the Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```
